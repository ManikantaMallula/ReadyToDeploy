      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Our journey began in Hyderabad, where Eshwar and Sravani, driven by a shared passion for technology, embarked on a learning adventure. Inspired by the possibilities of Django and Python, the idea for Food Tracker took root.</p>
      <p>Late nights of coding, problem-solving sessions, and a dash of creativity marked the development phase. As backend developers at Ojas Innovative Technologies, we combined our skills to create an application that goes beyond tracking â€“ it's a companion for your nutritional well-being.</p>
      <p>Food Tracker is more than just an app; it's a reflection of our dedication, learning, and the joy of creating something meaningful. We faced challenges, celebrated victories, and the result is a user-friendly tool that puts you in control of your nutrition.</p>
